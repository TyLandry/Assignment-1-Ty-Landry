            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 34-year-old student in my first year of a Software Development program. My passion for technology drives me to explore various fields, with a particular interest in cybersecurity. After earning my Software Development diploma, I plan to further my education by pursuing a degree in cybersecurity. I am also fascinated by web design and video game design, which fuel my creativity and problem-solving skills. Outside of academics, I enjoy gaming, playing and watching hockey, spending time with my dogs, and immersing myself in learning more about coding and technology. These hobbies not only provide balance in my life but also align with my goal of building a dynamic career in the tech world.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy gaming, playing hockey, spending time with my dogs, and learning more about coding and technology. I was a chef for approximately 15 years before starting my transition into the tech field. Technology has always been a passion of mine, and I look forward to pursuing a career in a field I really enjoy.</p>
